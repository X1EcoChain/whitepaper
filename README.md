## 9. Bonding Curve – A Unique Presale Mechanism

The **Bonding Curve** is a dynamic pricing model where the price of X1 Coin automatically increases with rising demand.

This creates a fair and transparent mechanism for early buyers.

Bonding Curve Formula::

The more tokens sold — the higher the price.

| Coins sold | Цена X1 Coin ($) |  |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **SEED** 50M |           0.04 → 0.06 |  |
| **PRIVATE** 80M |           0.06 → 0.08 |  |
| **PUBLIC** 100M |           0.08 → 0.10 |  |

Two Key Factors That Drive the Price of X1 Coin:

1. Every 60 minutes, the coin price increases.
2. The price is recalculated when the allocated volume of coins for each hour is bought out.

The price will increase either when the hour passes or earlier if the allocated hourly volume is sold out.

Listing price: $0.30
